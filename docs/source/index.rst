NanoCETPy
=========

NanoCETPy is a Python library with several modules to control the NanoCET device or parts of its functionality (e.g. alignment)

It is, as of now, not meant to be installed as package, considering its use case in controlling the device only makes sense at the highest level of code.

This documentation intends to show how to use the code and how it is structured in general. As all other exisiting modules are also contained in ``sequential`` only it is explained in some detail.
